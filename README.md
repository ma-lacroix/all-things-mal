# all-things-mal

A repo where I push my personal coding projects, learning new things and keep track of my progress. 

I'm a marketing analyst who got very serious about pushing my technical skills several years ago. Github is a wonderful tool to help me achieve this.

Lately I've been challenging myself by learning C++, a powerful language typically not reserved for people in my field. In this repo you will find a collection of personal projects on this topic.
