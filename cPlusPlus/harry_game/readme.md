<h2>Hipster Harry game</h2>

A very simple jump and run game using the <a href='https://www.sfml-dev.org/'>SFML library</a>.<br> I wrote this code to improve my C++ and learn more about building video games and software design patterns.

Special thanks to Hilze Vonck and his SFML tutorial. He's awesome.<br>
