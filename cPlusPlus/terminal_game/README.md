<h2>Hello and welcome to my version of Tetris in the terminal!</h2>

I built this version of Tetris using Ncurses as a project to practice what I've learned so far in C++. The game won't win any GOTY awards, but it was fun to program nevertheless. 
This is still a work in progress; some known bugs and missing functionalities have yet to be implemented.
